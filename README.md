# Zune Data Viewer

## What is ZDV?

Zune Data Viewer is a library and a Windows Phone 7 application that allows developers to access the undocumented Microsoft Zune web API. Since this API is not officially supported and made public by Microsoft, changes can occur without prior notification. If you encounter any issues with obtaining data through the managed API layer, use the Issue Tracker to report those.

>**NOTE:** Currently, Zune Data Viewer is in its Alpha stage â€“ some features might be missing or working not exactly as those are supposed to. The project is being continuously improved.

## Why ZDV?

Benefits from using Zune Data Viewer compared to open Zune API endpoints:

- Possibility to access the friend list (with recursive access to their friend list)
- Getting more metadata associated with media content (including pricing on the Zune Marketplace)
